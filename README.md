Realism Overhaul patches for Benjee10's Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit



These patches add Realism Overhaul, Real Fuels and FAR compatibility to the Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit.


An overview of the exact changes:

-Parts are scaled by 1.75, this ensures the orbiter dimensions are very close to the real one.

-Parts have their mass adjusted, the orbiter now weighs 76.xxxkg, the real one weighs 78.000kg.
The reason for this discrepancy is the emptier mid section of this mod. 

-DIRECT_KJ10 is changed into a AJ10-190 engine with 26Kn thrust, it also burns a mix of MMH/MON3 just like the
orbiter RCS. 1000 ignitions.

-Orbiter RCS have 2kn thrust. This is to simplify things. (the real shuttle had nozzles that could give over 3kn thrust and fine adjustment nozzles with as little as 0.1Kn thrust). Also burn MMH/MON3 and enjoy the same specific impulse of 316.



INSTALLATION:

DELETE original Patches folder in Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Benjee10_shuttleOrbiter, then replace with the Patches folder from here. 



ADDITIONAL NOTES/ISSUES

-The only part that should carry fuel is the aft fuselage section, however, there are tanks in every fuselage section, You may need Fuel Lines in order for the crossfeed to work properly though.

-The rudder that comes with this mod can NOT be used properly, due to limitations with FARControllableSurface, I advise you to use the stock spaceplane rudder and tweakscale.

-HTrobotic parts and the "C-100 Androgynous Docking Mechanism" are not touched.
